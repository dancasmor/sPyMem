Memory models
=============

This section contains a list of implemented spike-based bio-inspired hippocampal memory models and its configuration files. Each memory model is defined by a class and, for each of them, the following will be briefly discussed:

* The theoretical model they come from (references to papers, if applicable).

* The input parameters to instantiate them and connect them with their input and output layers.

* The model variables that can be accessed externally once instantiated.

* The configuration file with the parameters that define the network and how to tune it.
